## User Journey

### Discovery
User realizes they need a systematic approach when:
- A portfolio company announces a terrible vendor deal
- Multiple teams are buying AI tools without clear ROI
- Board members ask "Why didn't we see this coming?"

### Evaluation
User wants to know:
- Can I complete an assessment in under 30 minutes?
- Will this give me talking points I can actually use?
- Does it map to how I already think about risk?

### Adoption
User commits when they see:
- Risk scores that match their intuition
- Actionable recommendations, not generic advice
- Clear prioritization (who to call first)

### Retention
User continues when:
- Intervention prevents at least one bad purchase
- Tool saves time vs. manual portfolio review
- Outputs are share-worthy (can send to co-investors)

## Anti-Personas (Who This Is NOT For)

### Individual Contributors
Engineers, product managers, project leads within companies.  
**Why not:** They don't control capital decisions or have cross-company visibility.

### Vendors/Consultants Selling AI
Sales teams, vendor marketing, consultants pitching AI solutions.  
**Why not:** Creates conflict of interest; tool is designed to resist vendor capture.

### Academic Researchers
Universities, think tanks, policy analysts.  
**Why not:** Tool is designed for immediate business action, not theoretical analysis.

### Scenario 2: New Investment Due Diligence
Partner assesses leadership team's AI decision-making capability during investment evaluation. Risk scores influence investment thesis.

### Scenario 3: Crisis Response
