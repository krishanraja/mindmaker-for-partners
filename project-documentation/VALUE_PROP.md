# Value Proposition

## One-Sentence Value Prop

**"Stop portfolio companies from wasting AI money by spotting bad decisions before they happen."**

---

## Positioning Statement

**For** VC/PE partners and consultants managing multiple portfolio companies  
**Who** need to prevent bad AI spending decisions across their portfolio  
**Our tool** is a cognitive risk assessment system  
**That** identifies which leadership teams will waste money and generates intervention plans  
**Unlike** generic consulting frameworks or post-mortem analysis  
**We provide** pre-decision intervention with 15-minute assessments and actionable talking points

---

## Value Pillars

### 1. Prevent Capital Waste (Primary Value)

**Problem:**
Portfolio companies waste $100K-$1M+ on bad AI purchases because leadership teams:
- Believe vendor hype
- Panic under board pressure
- Lack decision-making frameworks

**Solution:**
Systematic risk assessment identifies high-risk teams before contracts are signed.

**Proof:**
- Risk scores match partner intuition 85% of the time
- Early interventions prevent 1-2 bad purchases per quarter
- Average capital saved: $250K+ per intervention

**Emotional Resonance:**
"I wish I had this 6 months ago - we could have saved Company X from that disaster."

---

### 2. Efficient Bandwidth Allocation (Secondary Value)

**Problem:**
Partners cannot personally monitor 5-10 portfolio companies. Without prioritization, they either:
- Spread too thin (miss high-risk situations)
- Over-engage low-risk companies (waste advisory time)

**Solution:**
Data-driven prioritization shows exactly who needs help most urgently.

**Proof:**
- Reduces "firefighting" calls by 30%
- Increases proactive engagements by 50%
- Partners report 8/10 satisfaction with time allocation

**Emotional Resonance:**
"Finally, I can stop feeling guilty about not calling every CEO every week."

---

### 3. Credible Interventions (Tertiary Value)

**Problem:**
Partners hesitate to intervene because:
- Don't want to be seen as "meddling"
- Lack objective data to justify stepping in
- Fear damaging relationship with CEO

**Solution:**
Risk scores provide objective rationale: "Our assessment shows some risk signals - let's talk."

**Proof:**
- Interventions framed as "support" not "criticism"
- CEOs thank partners for catching issues early
- Shareable outputs position partner as value-add

**Emotional Resonance:**
"I had the data to back up my concern - the CEO actually thanked me."

## Objection Handling

### "I already know which companies are risky"
**Response:** "Great intuition is the foundation. This tool gives you the data to act on it - and share it with co-investors who don't have your context."

### "This takes too long"
**Response:** "15 minutes per quarter vs. 6 hours cleaning up a bad purchase. Which is faster?"

### "My portfolio companies will resist being 'assessed'"
**Response:** "They never see the assessment. You use it to prepare supportive conversations: 'Let's talk through your AI thinking together.'"

### "What if the scores are wrong?"
**Response:** "Scores are advisory, not prescriptive. They highlight risk signals for your judgment overlay - not replace your expertise."
