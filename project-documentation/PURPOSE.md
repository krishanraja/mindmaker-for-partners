# Purpose

## Problem Statement

Partners (VCs, PEs, consultants, system integrators) invest capital in portfolio companies pursuing AI initiatives. Many leadership teams waste money on AI projects because they:

1. **Believe vendor hype** without asking hard questions
2. **Lack clear thinking frameworks** for AI decisions
3. **Make panic purchases** under board pressure
4. **Cannot distinguish good AI spend from bad**

Partners need a systematic way to identify which portfolio companies are at risk of wasting capital before deals are signed.

## What This App Does

Provides partners with a **cognitive risk assessment system** to:

- Score portfolio companies based on 7 decision-making dimensions
- Identify which leadership teams will waste money on AI
- Generate actionable intervention plans
- Prioritize companies needing immediate support

---

## Core Value

**Prevent capital waste by spotting bad decisions before they happen.**

Instead of reacting after money is spent, partners can:
- Intervene early when risk signals appear
- Provide targeted support to high-risk teams
- Let low-risk teams operate independently
- Justify advisory bandwidth allocation with data

## How It Works (User Flow)

1. **Partner describes their portfolio** - firm type, objectives, companies
2. **Partner assesses each company** across 7 dimensions:
   - Are they buying vendor stories or asking hard questions?
   - How clear is their thinking?
   - How do they make big decisions?
   - Will they believe vendor promises?
   - How urgent is the pressure?
   - How sophisticated is sponsor thinking?
   - Will they listen to advice?

3. **System calculates risk scores** for each company:
   - Cognitive risk score (0-100, higher = more waste risk)
   - Capital at risk (estimated dollars)
   - Cognitive readiness (ability to spot BS)

4. **System generates outputs:**
   - Capital Risk Map (heatmap visualization)
   - Diagnostic Brief (company-by-company analysis)
   - Intervention Plan (who to call first, what to say)

## What This Is NOT

- Not an AI training tool
- Not a general consulting framework
- Not a post-mortem analysis tool
- Not a vendor evaluation platform

This is a **pre-decision intervention system** to stop capital waste before it starts.

## Success Criteria

Partners successfully using this tool will:
1. Identify high-risk companies within 15 minutes
2. Generate actionable talking points for first conversations
3. Prioritize intervention efforts based on risk + capital exposure
4. Prevent at least one bad AI purchase per quarter

## Design Philosophy

- **Plain English, not academic** - "Will they waste money?" not "Cognitive readiness assessment"
- **Empathetic, real-world tone** - Like a conversation with a trusted advisor
- **Actionable outputs** - "Call this team Monday" not "Gaps identified"
- **Fast workflow** - Complete assessment in under 20 minutes
