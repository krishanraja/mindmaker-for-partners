## Anti-Outcomes (What Users Should NOT Experience)

### False Positives
- Tool flags low-risk company as high-risk
- Partner intervenes unnecessarily
- Damages trust with portfolio company

**Mitigation:**
- Risk scores are advisory, not prescriptive
- Encourages partner judgment overlay
- Provides context with scores (not just numbers)

### Analysis Paralysis
- User spends 60+ minutes tweaking assessments
- Over-analyzes edge cases
- Delays action while seeking "perfect" data

**Mitigation:**
- Clear time expectations (< 20 minutes)
- Emphasis on "directionally correct" over "perfectly precise"
- Action-oriented outputs ("call this team Monday")

### Over-Reliance on Tool
- Partner stops using own judgment
- Treats risk scores as absolute truth
- Ignores qualitative signals not captured in assessment

**Mitigation:**
- Framing tool as "decision support" not "decision maker"
- Encourages combining scores with partner intuition
- Outputs include caveats and limitations

---

## Outcome-Driven Design Principles

1. **Speed over precision** - 80% accurate in 15 minutes beats 95% accurate in 2 hours
2. **Action over analysis** - Every output includes "what to do next"
3. **Empathy over judgment** - Tone positions partners as helpers, not critics
4. **Data-backed intuition** - Validates what partners already suspect + reveals blind spots
5. **Shareable by default** - Outputs designed to forward to co-investors, boards

## Success Story Template

> "I used the tool before our quarterly board meetings. It flagged Company X as high-risk - they were under board pressure and believing vendor promises. I scheduled a call, and we discovered they were about to sign a $500K contract for an AI tool they didn't need. We helped them ask better questions, and they decided to pilot instead. That conversation alone saved them $400K and probably saved me 20 hours of cleanup later."

**Key elements:**
- Specific use case (quarterly review)
- Risk signal detected (board pressure + vendor belief)
- Action taken (scheduled call)
- Outcome (prevented $500K waste)
- Secondary benefit (saved 20 hours)
