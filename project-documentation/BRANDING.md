## Brand Story Arc

### The Problem (Setup)
"You have 10 portfolio companies. Three of them are about to waste serious money on AI. You don't know which three. By the time you find out, the contracts are signed."

### The Insight (Complication)
"Bad AI spending isn't random. There are predictable patterns: vendor capture, panic buying, unclear thinking. But you can't personally assess every team every week."

### The Solution (Resolution)
"This tool gives you a systematic 15-minute assessment that identifies high-risk teams before the damage is done. Plain English questions, data-backed insights, talking points you can actually use."

### Typography Voice

- **Larger text on mobile** = Accessible, not intimidating

### Layout Voice
- **Linear workflow** = Clear path, no confusion

## Tone Guidelines by User Emotion

### When User is Anxious
**They feel:** "I don't have time for this"  
**We sound:** "15 minutes. That's it."  
**Avoid:** Long explanations, optional fields, complexity

### When User is Skeptical
**They feel:** "Will this actually help?"  
**We sound:** "This matches how you already think about risk - we just give you the data."  
**Avoid:** Overpromising, jargon, unproven claims

### When User is Overwhelmed
**They feel:** "I have too many companies to track"  
**We sound:** "We'll show you exactly who needs help most."  
**Avoid:** More options, customization, decision paralysis

### When User is Defensive
**They feel:** "I don't need a tool to tell me how to do my job"  
**We sound:** "You already know who's at risk. This gives you the data to act on it."  
**Avoid:** Prescriptive language, judgment, criticism

## Copy Testing Checklist

Before publishing any user-facing copy, ask:

1. **Plain English Test:** Would a 10th grader understand this?
2. **Empathy Test:** Would I say this to a stressed colleague over coffee?
3. **Action Test:** Does this tell the user what to DO next?
4. **Jargon Test:** Can I remove any business/academic buzzwords?
5. **Honesty Test:** Is this what the tool actually does, or what we wish it did?
